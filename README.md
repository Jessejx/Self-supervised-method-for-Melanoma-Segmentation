## Background
Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a novel method of deep learning, can be regarded as an intermediate form between unsupervised and supervised learning, which can avoid expen- sive and time-consuming data annotations and collections. It learns in two steps. First, SSL methods were learned visual features with automatically generated labels (i.e., pretext task). Second, the learned features serve as a pre-trained model and are transferred to downstream tasks with few human-annotated labels (i.e., downstream task). Downstream tasks are multiple different tasks that are used to evaluate the quality of features such as melanoma segmentation by fine-tuning. In this repositories, we present pretext task (i.e., proposed model) and downstream task (i.e., pspnet)
